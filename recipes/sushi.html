    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Delicious and surprisingly simple to make. Sushi is expensive to buy at the supermarket, so making your own will save you tons of money. My husband is a sushi freak! I make this for him all the time.</p>    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>1 cup uncooked white rice</li>
          <li>2 cups water</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>2 sheets nori seaweed sheets</li>
          <li>¼ cucumber, peeled and sliced lengthwise</li>
          <li>2 pieces imitation crab legs</li>
          <li>½ (3 ounce) package cream cheese, sliced</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon minced fresh ginger root</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the rice and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the rice is tender, and the liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Stir in rice vinegar and salt. Allow to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Lay out seaweed sheets. Moisten hands with water, then spread the rice evenly on each sheet, leaving a 1/2 inch gap along one edge, lengthwise. Arrange strips of cucumber, imitation crabmeat, and cream cheese in a straight line along the side opposite of the gap. Roll the sushi from the toppings to the exposed end of the the seaweed sheet.</li>
            <li>Using a sharp wet knife, slice each roll into 5 or 6 pieces. Serve with minced ginger on the side.</li>
        </ol>
