# odin-recipes
First assignment on "The Odin Project," under the HTML section in Foundations. The goal of this project is to apply the skills of: terminal, git, and HTML to make a basic website. 

* Reminder! Be in your repos folder first, then clone, then cd into it!


# Process:

* Foundation:
    * mkdir images
    * mkdir pages
    * touch index.html
        * Every start to a single project will have a few folders and an index.html. So it's best to just get that out of the way.
